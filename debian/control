Description: implementation of the XDG Base Directory Specification and XDG user directories
 This package contains a Go implementation of the XDG Base Directory
 Specification and XDG user directories.
 .
 The specification defines a set of standard paths for storing application
 files, including data and configuration files. For portability and
 flexibility reasons, applications should use the XDG defined locations
 instead of hardcoding paths.
 .
 The package also includes the locations of well known user directories
 and an implementation of the state directory proposal.
 .
